A stable sort preserves the relative order of items with equal keys

Insertion sort: is stable because equal items never past each other

Selection sort: is NOT stable because Long-distance exchange might move an item past some equal item.

Shell sort: is NOT stable because of Long-distance exchanges

Merge sort: is stable as long as the merge operation is stable

Quick sort: is NOT stable
